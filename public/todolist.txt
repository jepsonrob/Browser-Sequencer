TO DO

	
	The larger plan:
	End goal - a multi-sequencer workstation utilising websockets (and node.js) for many connections to the same workspace.


	Front end:
		- make it look good!
		- make it responsive & working on mobile!
		- Make the sequencers change through the css display:hide element and buttons. 
		- Make the sequencers look nice and stuff with colours.
		- Title, footer, links... all the standard making a website bullshit.
		- Make the sliders look nicer and open when you press an 'advanced' button

	Client Code:
		
		- Encapsulate this script so there are no global variables, and make sure all buttons are pressed with event listeners/jQuery selectors.
		

	Server Code:
		- Save and load sequencer JSON files on server on/off
		- How to make them start at the same time!? (should be - needs testing!)
		- Get the synth settings changes input and then broadcast!
			(Number recieved will be the number to go to, client side then automates current number to move towards it at the rate of 1 bar.)
		- Make the chat room.

	
	Client audio plan:

		FOUR SEQUENCERS (with 4 phrase sequencers):
			- Percusson / Bass / Samples / Synthesizer
	
		Percussion: sampled
		Kicks / Snare / Hats / Other
		Bass / Harmony / Melody: Synthesized.

		Harmony: Sampled (w/ bank switching)
		Piano / Violin (switch out note length, when at lowest become pizzicato) / Harp / E. Piano(?) / 

	Effects for each: Distortion, Reverb, Delay, Bitcrush, Chorus, Tremolo.

	Synthesizers:
		2 Oscillators	[Sine/Square/Sawtooth/Noise]
		1 FM Oscillator [Sine/Square/Sawtooth/Noise]
		Oscillator level/gain
		Pitch change - Octave, Semitone, Detune
		Pitch Envelope

		2 Filters [ "lowpass", "highpass", "bandpass", "notch"]
		
		
	// NOTE! PHRASE SEQUENCERS ARE FUCKED WITH COLOUR


Random little things to-do list:

	- make sure the sequencer gets re-drawn even when stopped! (try changing phrase whilst sequencer is stopped. See?!)
	- Continue testing other devices and crying at how bad it runs
	- need to test and make sure the clients are properly syncronized!
	
	DONE TODAY:
		- fixed notes function
		- sync the server's phrase
		(- server needs to send the current phraseBeat, so it can syncronize clients)
		- Sort Out play button & sync it!
		- created canvas element with evenet listeners for sliders.
		- Did some testing on iOS and SHIT IS BAAAD!
		
	Done Day after!
		- effect automation sorted with canvas! Seems like a small thing but really it's quite big and great and I'm happy!

	

CURRENTLY WORKING ON:
	
	
NEXT TO DO:
	- server send/recieve effect changes
	- Final sequencer plan - Figure out exactly what sliders and buttons are needed! How to make it work on shitty devices? etc.
	- fully implement final design
	- Work on the front end and make it all look good & shit
	- Figure out audio system for extra 2(?) samplers!
