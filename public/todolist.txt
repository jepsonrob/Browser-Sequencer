TO DO

	
	The larger plan:
	End goal - a multi-sequencer workstation utilising websockets (and node.js) for many connections to the same workspace.


	Front end:
		- make it look good!
		- make it responsive & working on mobile!
		- Make the sequencers change through the css display:hide element and buttons. 
		- Make the sequencers look nice and stuff with colours.
		- Title, footer, links... all the standard making a website bullshit.
		- Make the sliders look nicer and open when you press an 'advanced' button

	Client Code:
		
		- Encapsulate this script so there are no global variables, and make sure all buttons are pressed with event listeners/jQuery selectors.
		

	Server Code:
		- Save and load sequencer JSON files on server on/off
		- How to make them start at the same time!? (should be - needs testing!)
		- Get the synth settings changes input and then broadcast!
			(Number recieved will be the number to go to, client side then automates current number to move towards it at the rate of 1 bar.)
		- Make the chat room.

	
	Client audio plan:

		FOUR SEQUENCERS (with 4 phrase sequencers):
			- Percusson / Bass / Samples / Synthesizer
	
		Percussion: sampled
		Kicks / Snare / Hats / Other
		Bass / Harmony / Melody: Synthesized.

		Harmony: Sampled (w/ bank switching)
		Piano / Violin (switch out note length, when at lowest become pizzicato) / Harp / E. Piano(?) / 

	Effects for each: Distortion, Reverb, Delay, Bitcrush, Chorus, Tremolo.

	Synthesizers:
		2 Oscillators	[Sine/Square/Sawtooth/Noise]
		1 FM Oscillator [Sine/Square/Sawtooth/Noise]
		Oscillator level/gain
		Pitch change - Octave, Semitone, Detune
		Pitch Envelope

		2 Filters [ "lowpass", "highpass", "bandpass", "notch"]
		
		
	// NOTE! PHRASE SEQUENCERS ARE FUCKED WITH COLOUR

	THE DEAL WITH THE SLIDERS:
	
	* Slider Objects: Contains all kinds of useful info (slider's canvas, values at certain points, whether it has been triggered etc.)
	* WE THEN SET UP EVERY SLIDER!
	* effectArray: a piece of shit made to make for easy looping. Contains every slider object (in the same order as the server!), which is useful for loops.
	* addNumberstoSequencerObject: uses effectArray to number every effect incrementally. This has purpose, at some point, I'm sure.
	* socket.on("effectStatus", function(serverArray) then happens! The serverArray is an array with all the server's stored effect values, in the exact same order as the effectArray! For this reason, we're then able to change effectArray[x] - the selected/correctly numbered effect in the client.
	* We then loop through x for the length of effectArray and use a shitload of conditionals to see where the value ought to go. This is the bad bit, but it makes sense.

Sampler, different sample 'packs' available: e-piano, harp, violin, piano

Synth 4:
Percussion - able to swap out sample 'packs' for perc,hat,snare & kick. 4 packs each.



Random little things to-do list:

	- git push after each git commit
	- make sure the sequencer gets re-drawn even when stopped! (try changing phrase whilst sequencer is stopped. See?!) (will be fixed when canvases have their own loops!)
	- Continue testing other devices and crying at how bad it runs
	- test how process heavy 4 reverbs is.
	- you can use .rampTo(1,3) to make effects change. That is useful information I wish I had a while ago! https://github.com/Tonejs/Tone.js/wiki/Effects
	- Sequencer settigns not being sent to server?!
	
	
DONE SINCE LAST COMMIT:

	- Confused myself about what is going on with this to do list, but commit anyway because I'm just like that.
	- made Synth 3 & 4 Work! And the banks can now be switched out!
	- Implemented the radio button system for switching out oscillators, filter types (and dropdown for sample banks.)
	- Made the 8 banks for the 2 samplers. And made it so they could work on an offset. And made it all work via the server, too!
	- Basically, ALMOST ALL THE BACK END IS FINISHED! :D
		
	

CURRENTLY WORKING ON:




	
NEXT TO DO:
	
	- Make a loading screen
	- Implement the frontend
	- Squash bugs, obviously.
	- Volume needs to be sorted: the effects (I think) go through to their own wet/dry outputs - we need to connect everything in the chain to one volume/gain node!
	- fully implement final design
	- Design the front end - what will it look like?!
